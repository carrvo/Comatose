## Intro
Feel free to share it! Let me know if you beat it!
Just point people back to me and don't commercialize it.

###### November 2019
It has been four and a half years since I created this as my first game, and I have yet to hear of someone even reaching the boss...

Today I made the monumental movement to sharing it more publicly in a way that also can be used to demonstrate my growth in programming expertise and software languages learned.

I hope to make it available in as many software languages as I can (and will learn) and as many platforms as I can (and will pay attention to); with additional hopes that someone, somewhere, sometime will finally beat it.
