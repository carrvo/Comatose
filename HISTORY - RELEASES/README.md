# HISTORY

This folder is for older releases that pre-date my use of version control software for this project.

## Structure

### Comatose.zip

the original version in C++ and compiled for Windows

### Coma2.zip

my second version (and first update) in C++ and compiled for Windows

### comatose3.zip

my first conversion to Python3

### Comatose3.5.zip

combining Coma2 and comatose3 BUT running \[whatever it was called] to convert it into Python2.7 because that was still the default Python shipped in all major distributions (except Windows) at the time

### Comatose3.5.1.zip

an update to the Python side of Comatose3.5 (still converted to Python2.7).

## Latest

The latest can be found in the parent folder, under `bin`.

# READ ME

## Intro
Feel free to share it! Let me know if you beat it!
Just point people back to me and don't commercialize it.

###### November 2019
It has been four and a half years since I created this as my first game, and I have yet to hear of someone even reaching the boss...

Today I made the monumental movement to sharing it more publicly in a way that also can be used to demonstrate my growth in programming expertise and software languages learned.

I hope to make it available in as many software languages as I can (and will learn) and as many platforms as I can (and will pay attention to); with additional hopes that someone, somewhere, sometime will finally beat it.
